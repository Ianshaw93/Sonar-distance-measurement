# SonarRangeFinder
Utilising the Arduino Uno and sonar sensor to give measurement in realtime to the LCD display.

The distance to target was calculated by the time for the ultrasonic pulse to echo back to the sensor multiplied by the speed of sound all divided by two.

# What I Learned

* How to setup ultrasound sensor including setup of trigger and echo pins within C++
* How to physically setup circuitry to ultrasound sensor
