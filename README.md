# SonarRangeFinder
Utilising the Arduino Uno and sonar sensor to give measurement in realtime to the LCD display.

This included converting time for the ultrasonic pulse to echo back to sensor (travelling at the speed of sound), to distance to target.

# What I Learned

* How to setup ultrasound sensor including setup of trigger and echo pins within C++
* How to physically setup circuitry to ultrasound sensor
